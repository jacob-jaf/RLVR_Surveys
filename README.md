# RLVR_Surveys

This repo contains initial code for doing RLVR to ensure alignment and safety in the political context. 
This project adds a few things to this research context - 
1) It utilizes RLVR with novel forms of data, like survey data, which is broadly applicable beyond this particular use case. 
2) It distills the general goals of RLVR in political safety to a number of goals and weights verifiable rewards with a linear combination of them:
    norm adherence, political pluralism, ethical consistency, and consensus.
3) It defines new metrics for these quantities which are useful beyond this project.
4) It defines per-response pluralism as opposed to the distributional pluralism so far used among LLMs.
